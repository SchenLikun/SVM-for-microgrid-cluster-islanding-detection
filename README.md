# Introduction
This paper has been published on IEEE trans. on Smart Grid.

I established a complex microgrid cluster systems based on IEEE-123 system, the whole project is using RTDS to generate datasetã€‚

***Due to the requirements of the funding project, the code for the multi-SVM and entropy parts of this paper cannot be shared at the moment.***

***Therefore, only the RTDS modeling and the RTDS script for automatic operation to generate data are provided here.***

***Simply Run ".src" file in RSCAD, you can get the same dataset as tested in our paper***
