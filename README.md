# Introduction
This paper has been published on IEEE trans. on Smart Grid.

I established a complex microgrid cluster systems based on IEEE-123 system, the whole project is using RTDS to generate dataset

***The RTDS modeling and the RTDS script for automatic operation to generate dataset are provided here***

***Simply Run ".src" file in RSCAD, you can get the same dataset as tested in our paper (Reserve at least 2GB space at target diectory)***
